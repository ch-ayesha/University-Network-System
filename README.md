# University-Network-System
This University Network Scenario is about designing the topology of the University
LAN network where various computers are set up in different departments so that they
can communicate and communicate through data exchange. Designing a university
communication environment that connects different departments with each other,
prioritizes communication between different departments. CNS is used to design a
structured and well-organized topology, satisfying all college needs (e.g. client). The
CNS comes with an efficient network.
#Objectives: -
The main objective of the proposed network is to update the network and also enhance
capabilities and increase the flexibility of the network which will eventually provide
good security.
#Network Requirements: -
 The new system should be able to reduce internet downtime.
 Download and upload links should be maintained above 5 Mbps speed requirement.
 Network will be scalable.
 The system should support remote access.
 Should comprise of data centers with necessary security features and support.
